# **You're Wasting Time in Meetings. Here's How to Stop.**

Let's be honest: most meetings are a waste of time. They're often poorly planned, poorly run, and poorly attended. And the result is that we all end up spending hours of our precious time in unproductive conversations that go nowhere.

But it doesn't have to be this way. You can stop wasting time in meetings and start making them more effective. Here's how:

## **The Root of the Problem**

The first step to solving any problem is to understand its root cause. And the root cause of unproductive meetings is simple: a lack of discipline.

We don't take the time to plan our meetings, we don't stick to the agenda, and we don't follow up on action items. And the result is that our meetings become a black hole of time and energy.

## **The Solution: A More Disciplined Approach**

If you want to stop wasting time in meetings, you need to adopt a more disciplined approach. That means:

- **Creating a clear agenda for every meeting**
- **Inviting only the people who need to be there**
- **Starting and ending on time**
- **Staying on topic**
- **Assigning clear action items**
- **Following up to ensure that action items are completed**
