Transcribing an in-person meeting (where participants are in the same room) can be challenging. If you use Google Meet to record the session, all voices are captured on one audio channel, making it hard to tell who said what. SeaMeet's Speaker Identification feature is designed to solve this problem. It leverages advanced AI to differentiate speakers in your meeting transcript and lets you assign the correct names, resulting in a clear, readable record of your discussion.

## Why Speaker Identification Matters for Meetings

In a multi-speaker meeting, a raw transcript can become confusing very quickly – you might see a long block of text without any indication of speaker changes. It's important to know who said each comment for accurate minutes and follow-ups. SeaMeet addresses this through audio diarization – an AI process that detects when different people are speaking. By specifying the number of participants, SeaMeet can separate the transcript into segments for each speaker (e.g. Speaker 1, Speaker 2, Speaker 3). This feature works best for meetings with about 2–6 people for optimal accuracy.

## Identifying Speakers in an In-Person Meeting

Using SeaMeet's Identify Speakers tool is straightforward. You start by indicating how many people were in the meeting. SeaMeet will then re-split the entire transcript according to that number. The system goes through the recording and groups the dialogue by speaker, labeling each segment with a placeholder name like Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc. During this identification process, you don't have to wait around – you can leave the meeting interface and come back later, as SeaMeet will continue processing in the background. Once complete, you'll see the transcript neatly divided and labeled by different speakers, giving you an initial diarization of the conversation.

SeaMeet's Identify Speakers dialog allows you to specify the number of speakers in the meeting. By inputting the actual participant count, SeaMeet uses audio diarization to separate the transcript into individual speakers.

SeaMeet's speaker diarization is quite powerful, but remember that at this stage the speakers are just numbered. For example, you might see Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 labels, which are generic. The next step will be to replace those with real names.

## Changing Speaker Labels to Real Names

After the initial identification, you'll want to assign the correct names to each speaker. SeaMeet makes this easy with the Change Speakers feature. First, you can listen to the audio segments for each identified speaker (SeaMeet lets you play back just the portions of the recording where, say, Speaker 1 was talking). This helps you confirm who Speaker 1 or Speaker 2 actually is. Once you recognize a voice, you can select the appropriate participant's name or even create a new name if that person wasn't originally in the attendee list.

When changing a speaker label, SeaMeet gives you flexible options. You can choose to replace the speaker tag just for a specific line of dialogue, or apply it to all instances of that speaker throughout the transcript. For example, if Speaker 1 is John Doe, you can replace one line's speaker tag with John's name, or update every line attributed to Speaker 1 in one go. After you've gone through all the speakers and swapped out the generic labels with real names, the transcript will be updated accordingly – now every line is attributed to the correct person, greatly improving the clarity of the record.

After using "Change Speakers" to assign actual names, the transcript is updated with the correct speaker names. In this screenshot, placeholder labels like Speaker 1 have been replaced with real participant names, making the conversation easy to follow.

This step ensures that your transcript isn't just technically accurate, but also human-friendly. It's much easier to read "John: Let's schedule a follow-up meeting next week." than a vague "Speaker 1: Let's schedule a follow-up...", especially when reviewing meetings later.

## Regenerating the Meeting Summary with Correct Speakers

One of SeaMeet's highlights is its automatic meeting summary. Initially, the AI-generated summary might refer to people generically (since it didn't know the names before). But once your transcript has the correct speaker names, you can regenerate the meeting summary to reflect these changes. With a click of the "Regenerate Meeting Summary" button, SeaMeet's AI will produce a new summary that includes the proper names and attributions based on the adjusted transcript.

Just like the speaker identification process, summary regeneration runs in the cloud – you can trigger it and then leave the page, and come back when it's done. The updated summary will read naturally, e.g. "John proposed a new project timeline, and Jane agreed to review the plan," instead of using placeholders. This personalized touch not only makes the summary easier to understand but also more useful for anyone who couldn't attend the meeting.

## Conclusion

SeaMeet's speaker identification feature brings a professional polish to your in-person meeting transcripts. By separating speakers and labeling them with the correct names, you ensure that everyone's contributions are clearly documented. Coupled with the ability to regenerate summaries with those names, SeaMeet saves you time and hassle in producing accurate meeting records. It transforms a jumbled raw transcript into an organized dialogue, so you'll never have to play detective guessing who said what. Whether it's a team meeting, a panel discussion, or a brainstorming session, letting SeaMeet handle the "who said what" lets you focus on the content of the conversation – and that means better meetings and better outcomes. `;export{e as default};
