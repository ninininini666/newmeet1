In today’s fast-paced workplace, meetings are everywhere, and time is precious. Yet traditional minute-taking is often slow, labor-intensive, and prone to missing crucial insights. That doesn’t serve a team that needs to move quickly.

Enter **SeaMeet**—an intelligent, **AI-powered meeting assistant that combines cutting-edge speech recognition** with **large language models (LLMs)**. It offers a full suite of **AI-Powered Meeting Summaries**: from real-time transcription and key-point extraction to automated decision tagging and action item identification. SeaMeet doesn’t just record your meetings—it understands them and empowers your team to execute outcomes.

Whether you're in a boardroom, on a Google Meet, or uploading an external audio file (think lectures, client calls, or webinar recordings), SeaMeet transforms every session into **structured, accessible knowledge**, making post-meeting follow-up seamless and impactful.

## How SeaMeet Uses AI to Deliver High-Quality Meeting Notes？
High-quality meeting notes must be complete, precise, and well-structured. SeaMeet delivers them by integrating:

### Real-Time Transcription & Smart Summaries

Once **SeaMeet Copilot** joins your Google Meet, it begins **real-time transcription, tagging speakers and timestamps accurately**. Trained to handle **mixed English–Chinese speech** (especially **tailored for Taiwan**, but equally effective elsewhere), it captures your conversation faithfully.

But SeaMeet goes beyond transcription. Powered by **NLP and LLMs**, it **parses meaning and context—detecting structure, extracting keywords, understanding relationships—then auto-generates**:
- Meeting Summary

- Action Items

- Discussion Topics

These snapshots are updated in real time, and you can export a full summary at any point. A "team notes" feature also lets members collaboratively add agenda points, decisions, or additional details—ensuring continuity from prep to recap.


### Speaker Recognition
For in-person meetings, SeaMeet’s speaker ID tool segments transcripts into individual speakers (e.g. "Speaker 1"、"Speaker 2"). Simply confirm names from supplied audio snippets—or batch-replace each speaker’s contributions. Once identities are assigned, **regenerate the summary to reflect real names, ensuring clarity and accountability**.

This whole process happens asynchronously—you don’t need to stay logged in—so your final notes are polished and ready when you return.

### Industry-Tuned for Complex Dialogues
SeaMeet’s LLM backbone is trained on **massive Chinese and mixed-language corpora and fine-tuned across industries** like legal, medical, and software development. So even during technical discussions or rapid exchanges, SeaMeet delivers fast, accurate transcriptions and intelligible, insight-rich summaries. AI not only captures content—it understands intent.

## Upload External Audio Files for Full Coverage

Not all critical discussions happen live. Client calls, conference sessions, or sales outreach recordings often hold valuable insights—if only they were captured.

SeaMeet solves this with the External Audio Upload feature:
- Upload in popular formats (.mp3, .wav, .m4a, etc.)
- Set language, title, and optional timestamp
- Click "Start" to launch automatic transcription and summary generation

<img src="/images/launch-automatic-transcription-and-summary-generation2.png" alt="Launch transcription and summary generation step 2" style="max-width:500px; width:100%; height:auto;" />

<img src="/images/launch-automatic-transcription-and-summary-generation3.png" alt="Launch transcription and summary generation step 3" style="max-width:500px; width:100%; height:auto;" />


The results? A structured transcript paired with **a refined summary** you can edit—add action items, highlight insights, share asynchronously, or export to Google Docs. It ensures nothing valuable is lost.

## Customizable Summary Templates
Every meeting has a purpose—sales demos need different notes than stand-ups or legal strategy sessions. SeaMeet recognizes this by offering customizable summary templates:
- Select from built-in options for department syncs, client updates, webinar notes, legal prep, etc.

- Use "add template" to create your own—specify layout cues in natural language prompts

- After meetings, apply templates for automatic reformatting and, if enabled, share updates via email

- Set templates to auto-apply to recurring meetings like daily stand-ups
