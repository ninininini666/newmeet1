In today’s fast-paced workplaces, **organizing meetings efficiently, ensuring consistent information flow, and fostering seamless collaboration** are challenges every organization must address. SeaMeet is a smart collaboration platform built for professional meeting scenarios. Centered on the core principles of **sharing meetings, assigning follow-ups, and organizing across teams**, SeaMeet offers a comprehensive and flexible solution to help teams achieve smooth coordination and streamlined communication.

## Centralized Management of Meetings and Team Members
SeaMeet’s Workspace feature offers a centralized environment for managing meetings, team members, and plans. Organizations can create shared workspaces based on their structure—such as departments, projects, or business units—so that team members can collaboratively access and manage meeting content.

Within each workspace, all meetings—whether upcoming, ongoing, or completed—are stored in one place, making it easy to track and retrieve information. From the Workspace Settings – Users panel, admins can add team members, assign roles, or remove users. Admins have full control, including managing access, deleting meetings, and inviting others, while regular members can view (or be limited to viewing only their meetings), edit content, and invite others as members only.

SeaMeet supports the creation of multiple independent workspaces for different projects or departments, enabling clear task allocation and team separation. Users can also customize default meeting language and storage location via their Personal Settings, as well as choose their preferred interface language for a more personalized experience.

To maintain data security, only administrators are allowed to delete meetings, and this must be done via the menu next to the meeting title.

## Streamlined Management Across Multiple Workspaces
For enterprise users, SeaMeet offers a Team Plan, which introduces enhanced controls for permissions and resource allocation. The first user to create a workspace is designated as the Workspace Owner, who holds the highest level of authority and can manage multiple workspaces and all associated members.

The subscription is tied to the Workspace Owner’s account, and all workspaces created under this account share the same Team Plan benefits. To ensure seamless resource sharing across workspaces, they must all be created by the same owner.

SeaMeet uses unique user ID counting to prevent duplicate billing—if a team member belongs to multiple workspaces, they are counted only once. For example, if four employees are invited to two workspaces, and one person belongs to both, the system only counts five users in total (including the owner).

For details on workspace management, user billing, or enterprise plans, reach out to the SeaMeet team at seameet@seasalt.ai.

## Auto-Sharing Meeting Notes
Timely distribution of meeting notes is key to keeping teams aligned. SeaMeet offers automated sharing of meeting summaries via email immediately after a meeting ends, ensuring that key takeaways reach the right people quickly and consistently.

You can choose from several sharing preferences:
- Share with myself only – only you receive the meeting summary
- Share with all calendar invitees – automatically emails all participants invited via Google Calendar
- Share only with participants using the same email domain – ideal for internal distribution, keeping sensitive information within your organization
- Turn off sharing – no summaries are sent, not even to yourself

For more advanced sharing needs, SeaMeet provides Additional Lists and Block Lists. You can CC or BCC non-attendees (like project stakeholders or managers) to keep them informed, or block specific users—even if they’re listed in the calendar event—from receiving the notes.

This automation ensures that follow-up materials are always delivered on time, with minimal manual effort.

## Accurate Speaker Identification for In-Person Meetings
Capturing clear and accurate meeting records in multi-speaker, in-person meetings can be challenging. SeaMeet solves this with integrated tools for speaker identification, manual correction, and summary regeneration, especially when used with Google Meet recordings.

- **Identify Speakers**: Enter the number of speakers, and the system will analyze the recording and segment the dialogue accordingly. The process runs in the background, and results are labeled as “Speaker 1” , “Speaker 2”, etc.
- **Change Speakers**: If automatic identification is inaccurate, users can manually review audio snippets and reassign the correct speaker names—either line-by-line or in bulk.
- **Regenerate Summary**: After correcting speaker labels, users can regenerate the meeting summary to reflect the correct speaker contributions and ensure content accuracy.

This feature is especially useful for structured in-person meetings or interdepartmental discussions, where clarity and accountability in records are essential.

## Enhanced Team Collaboration Through AI-Powered Meeting Transcription and Analysis
One of SeaMeet’s standout features is its AI-based real-time transcription and automated meeting content analysis. When the virtual co-pilot (smart assistant) joins a meeting, it begins recording and tagging each speaker’s contributions and timestamps. The transcription engine is optimized for the Taiwan market and excels in environments with both Mandarin and English.

As the meeting unfolds, SeaMeet AI dynamically extracts and structures key information:
- **Meeting Summary**: A concise recap of the key points
- **Action Items**: Automatically identifies tasks, responsibilities, and decisions
- **Discussion Topics**: Highlights recurring themes or focal issues

To complement these automated insights, team members can also use the Team Notes feature to collaboratively add agenda items, decisions, or other contextual information, ensuring a more comprehensive and actionable record.
 
This combination of AI automation and human collaboration is ideal for bilingual or high-paced meeting environments and significantly reduces the manual burden of note-taking and follow-ups.

From meeting sharing, task tracking, and centralized management, to AI-powered summaries and cross-departmental coordination, it delivers a modern workspace that adapts to the needs of today’s teams.
