## Key Features
### Accurate, Real-Time Transcription

SeaMeet Copilot provides **accurate, multilingual, real-time transcription for online meetings.** Once it joins a Google Meet session, transcription begins instantly. It not only **converts speech into text**, but also **identifies speakers, marks speaking durations, and highlights tone changes, creating a structured and easy-to-read transcript.**
 
There's no need for manual note-taking or relying on secondhand summaries. Users can view the **full transcript**, read an **AI-generated meeting summary**, or **search for keywords to jump to specific moments**.
  

## Real-Time Transcription vs. Offline Transcription

Not all meeting transcription tools are created equal. One of the biggest differences lies in how fast the transcript becomes available — and this difference can dramatically affect user experience and meeting effectiveness.
 
Many tools on the market today, like OpenAI's Whisper, use an *8offline transcription** model: the meeting or audio is recorded first, and only after the session ends is the audio processed and converted into text. This means that during the meeting, participants cannot see any live transcript — they have to wait until everything is over.
 
Now contrast that with **real-time transcription**, like what SeaMeet offers. The moment **SeaMeet Copilot** joins a meeting, it begins generating live, **speaker-labeled transcripts**. Participants can follow along instantly, line by line, without missing a beat. This difference isn't just technical — it's deeply human.
 
Take one of our recent use cases: a client shared that one of their colleagues is hearing-impaired and relies entirely on **live subtitles** to follow meetings. If transcription is delayed until the end, that colleague is excluded from the conversation in real time. With SeaMeet, he can watch subtitles live as others speak, ensuring **inclusion and equal participation**.
 
And it's not just about accessibility. SeaMeet also provides a **real-time summary** alongside the transcript. If someone joins the meeting late — say 20 minutes in — they can simply glance at the summary to instantly catch up on what’s been discussed, without having to scroll through or ask for updates.
 
In fact, we've seen real-time transcription make a meaningful difference across a wide range of high-stakes contexts — where clarity, speed, and shared understanding## directly impact outcomes:

- In cross-border meetings, where participants speak different native languages, live multilingual transcription helps bridge communication gaps instantly — no one needs to wait for an offline transcript to understand what was said.

- In sales calls, reps can quickly highlight key pain points raised by the client while they’re still fresh, allowing for more agile responses.

- In HR interviews, recruiters can stay focused on the candidate while reviewing key quotes or moments in real time, without having to scribble down notes.

While offline transcription tools like Whisper are powerful for post-meeting analysis or content archiving, SeaMeet’s real-time transcription + summary## is purpose-built for teams who value ##immediacy, collaboration, and inclusion — right when it matters most.
