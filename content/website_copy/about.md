# **Our Mission: To Make Every Meeting Matter**

**We believe that meetings are at the heart of every great organization. But too often, they are a source of frustration and wasted time. That's why we created SeaMeet: to help teams have more productive, collaborative, and insightful meetings.**

## **Our Story**

SeaMeet was founded in 2019 by a team of experienced entrepreneurs and AI researchers who were tired of unproductive meetings. We saw an opportunity to use the power of AI to solve a problem that plagues every organization.

Today, SeaMeet is used by thousands of teams around the world to make their meetings more effective. We are proud to be part of the SeaSuite, a comprehensive suite of communication and productivity tools.
