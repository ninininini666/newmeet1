# Internationalization (i18n) Content Framework for SeaMeet

This document outlines the framework for translating and localizing the SeaMeet website content. The goal is to provide a consistent and high-quality user experience for our global audience.

## **1. Content Structure**

All website content will be stored in a structured format, such as JSON, to facilitate translation and localization. Each piece of content will have a unique key, and the value will be the translated string.

Here is an example of the JSON structure for the homepage:

```json
{
  "home": {
    "hero_title": "Stop Drowning in Meetings. Start Making Decisions.",
    "hero_subtitle": "SeaMeet is your 24/7 AI Meeting Copilot that records, transcribes, summarizes, and generates action items, so you can focus on what truly matters.",
    "cta_free": "Get Started for Free",
    "cta_sales": "Contact Sales"
  }
}
```

## **2. Language Support**

The website will initially be launched in English. However, we will be adding support for additional languages in the future. The following languages have been identified as potential targets:

- Spanish
- French
- German
- Japanese

## **3. Translation Process**

We will use a combination of machine translation and human review to translate the website content. All machine-translated content will be reviewed and edited by a native speaker to ensure accuracy and quality.

## **4. Localization**

In addition to translation, we will also localize the website content to ensure that it is culturally appropriate for each target market. This includes:

- **Currency and Payment:** Displaying prices in the local currency and supporting local payment methods.
- **Date and Time Formats:** Displaying dates and times in the local format.
- **Imagery and aGraphics:** Using imagery and graphics that are culturally appropriate for each target market.

By following this framework, we can ensure that the SeaMeet website provides a consistent and high-quality user experience for our global audience.
