In today’s fast-paced global economy, virtual meetings have become an essential part of everyday business operations. Whether it’s coordinating across multinational teams, communicating with overseas clients, or syncing domestic and international branches, the ability to effortlessly switch languages and capture real-time meeting content is critical to boosting productivity and accuracy.

SeaMeet, as an intelligent meeting assistant, features powerful multi-language and translation support as one of its core capabilities. In addition to its in-depth optimization for English and Traditional Chinese, **SeaMeet has now expanded its language support to include Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Cantonese, Vietnamese, Thai, Polish, Danish, and Hindi**, greatly enhancing its usability in international scenarios.


## Real-Time Transcription in Multiple Languages
When you invite SeaMeet Copilot to join a Google Meet, the system automatically activates its AI-powered speech recognition. Unlike many tools that only support single-language transcription, SeaMeet can simultaneously recognize and transcribe multiple languages in real time, displaying the content live on the meeting notes page.

For example, in a remote meeting between teams in Taiwan and the U.S., the Taiwanese representatives might present project updates in Traditional Chinese while their American colleagues ask questions and provide feedback in English. SeaMeet captures both languages in real time, automatically tagging speakers and timestamps, and intelligently segmenting content based on meaning.
 
Moreover, SeaMeet’s speech recognition has been localized specifically for Traditional Chinese, adeptly handling regional speech nuances and colloquial expressions common in Taiwan such as “這個案子 (this case),” “我等下補一封信給你 (I’ll send you a follow-up email shortly),” and “這邊可以再 review 一下 (we can review this again here).” These phrases are transcribed with impressive accuracy.
 

## How to Switch Meeting Language
SeaMeet supports multiple recording modes, including Traditional Chinese, English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, and more. You can switch the recording language at any time before or during the meeting to meet the needs of multilingual discussions.

- Set a Default Recording Language: Go to your account’s Preferences page and choose your preferred default language for future meetings. This setting will be automatically applied whenever you invite the SeaMeet Copilot, saving you time and hassle.

## Limitations of Other Tools Like Otter.ai
Many popular meeting transcription tools still offer limited language support. Take Otter.ai, for example — a widely used transcription service that supports English (US/UK), Spanish, and French transcription, though its interface is currently only available in English. While Otter.ai performs well with American and British English accents, it cannot automatically detect language switching in bilingual or mixed-language meetings, nor can it accurately transcribe sentences where English and Chinese are intermixed. Users often need to manually switch languages or subscribe to premium plans with additional translation features, increasing both complexity and cost.
 
SeaMeet, on the other hand, seamlessly recognizes mixed English and Chinese speech automatically, **without any manual switching**. This delivers a smooth and natural transcription experience, significantly boosting meeting efficiency for multilingual teams.
 
 
## Handling mixed-language contexts
Many professionals in Taiwan frequently speak in a blend of English and Chinese during meetings. Phrases like “這個 proposal 我們要 next Monday 前完成 (We need to finish this proposal by next Monday)” or “報價單已經給 vendor 了，等 confirm 再發 PR (The quote has been sent to the vendor; once confirmed, we’ll issue the PR)” are commonplace.
 
Most speech recognition systems struggle with these hybrid expressions, often producing errors or blank spots. Thanks to specialized training on targeted corpora, SeaMeet accurately captures such mixed-language sentences and properly segments and labels them. This capability not only significantly enhances transcription accuracy but also saves substantial time and manpower in post-meeting record consolidation — a real boon for industries heavy with bilingual terminology, including tech, finance, marketing, and design.
 
 
## Bilingual Outputs to Help You Quickly Grasp Meeting Essentials

SeaMeet is more than just a voice recorder — it’s your smart note-taking assistant. During or after meetings, it automatically generates structured summaries that include key discussion topics, action items, and decisions made.
 
Users can **freely choose the language of the summary output**. Whether you prefer to review meeting highlights in Traditional Chinese or need to send an English summary to overseas colleagues, SeaMeet makes it just one click away. These summaries are not simple machine translations; they incorporate contextual understanding and professional tone, ensuring natural, fluent communication.
 
For example:
 
Original Chinese summary: “下一步由 May 撰寫提案初稿，預計下週五交付。”
 
English translation: “May will prepare the first draft of the proposal, expected by next Friday.”
 
This attention to detail reflects SeaMeet’s deep grasp of business language context, far surpassing traditional translation tools.
 
 
## Cross-Department and Cross-Language Collaboration
### Project Collaboration Between Taiwan and U.S. Headquarters
A Silicon Valley-based SaaS company’s Taiwan branch handles localization design and tech development. Weekly project review meetings see the Taiwan team primarily speaking Traditional Chinese while U.S. colleagues ask questions and provide feedback in English. SeaMeet fully transcribes the bilingual discussion and automatically produces summaries in both languages for teams to reference and archive. After meetings, Taiwanese staff can quickly prepare reports, while American managers immediately grasp key points.
 
### Briefing Reviews with Foreign Consultants at a Domestic Enterprise
A publicly traded company invited an international brand consultant to participate in a marketing briefing review. The consultant spoke in English while the internal team discussed and supplemented in Traditional Chinese. With SeaMeet’s speech recognition and bilingual summary capabilities, the complete meeting minutes were quickly compiled in both languages, dramatically reducing the time needed for information flow and consolidation across departments.


## Conclusion
We firmly believe that language should never be a barrier to collaboration but rather a bridge for communication. Powered by AI, SeaMeet continues to advance its **multi-language capabilities**, helping every meeting run smoothly, efficiently, and without miscommunication. If you regularly participate in **bilingual meetings** or want to enhance the efficiency of post-meeting content organization and information sharing, SeaMeet’s multi-language and translation support will be your most trusted digital assistant.
